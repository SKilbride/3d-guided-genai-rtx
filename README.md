# Description: 
The 3D Guided Generative AI Blueprint unlocks greater control over image generation by laying out the content in Blender to guide the image layout. Users can quickly alter the look of the 3D scene using generative AI, and the image outputs can be iterated on by making simple changes in the 3D viewport - such as changing the image perspective by adjusting the camera angle in Blender. Creators can ideate on scene environments much faster using generative AI, and adjustments are made much faster due to the control offered by using the viewport as a depth map.    

The blueprint produces high-quality outputs by leveraging the FLUX.dev NIM, using Black Forest Labs' state-of-the-art FLUX.dev models, and ComfyUI provides a flexible and convenient UI. The models are quantized and accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs, doubling performance and enabling this workflow to run on consumer GPUs. Sample image generation times using 30 steps at 1024x1024 resolution on a GeForce RTX 5090:

| NIM | Native (FP8) |
| ------- | -------- |
| 11 sec  | 25  sec  |

# Installing the Blueprint:

Open a command prompt at the location where you would like the Blueprint files to be installed.

Download the Blueprint using Git.
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/3d-guided-genai-rtx.git
```
Then 
```
cd 3d-guided-genai-rtx
```

From 3d-guided-genai-rtx folder, run Setup.bat (It is recommended to run this batch file from the command line)

The setup installer will install ComfyUI, the ComfyUI plugin for Blender, and other components required for the blueprint. 

Installation will take up to 20 minutes depending on download speed.  
Once complete the installation will list the ComfyUI Path, and Python Path, this information will be used to set up the Blender ComfyUI add-on.   
![Untitled-5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef8f876b-883a-4afe-8820-5b97908da86c)

# Configure Blender:

Once installation is complete start Blender and press open Preferences from the menu: Edit \>\>Preferences

![Untitled-23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ecab817-b5bd-48a1-a4d3-70acd4bdbd6a)

![Untitled-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c590611c-de8c-409f-962f-a497f48228a5)

If necessary expand the panel in the upper left viewport by clicking on the \< indicator. Alternatively move the mouse into the upper left viewport and press the “n” key on the keyboard.
![Untitled-13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5416a9ce-876d-4db0-bdfb-aba3553b2c85)

Select the ComfyUI X Blender tab if needed. Click the **Launch/Connect to ComfyUI** button to start a local ComfyUI server instance. 

It may take up to two minutes to start the ComfyUI service and establish a connection.  
![Untitled-14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc0aed22-5f45-40ee-8d18-873a58424e1d)

NOTE:  The Blender system console can be opened from the Blender Menu selection Window \>\> Toggle System Console. The system console can help provide additional information about the ComfyUI startup process and provide updates while ComfyUI tasks are running.

Once ComfyUi has started and is ready the panel will change and a **Run** button will appear.  
![Untitled-15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9863ece0-0a29-4e0e-9362-535767c89091)

If the Run button does not appear or the **Launch/Connect to ComfyUI** reappears, check the system console for any error messages.

Click the Run button.

The first time the FLUX NIM is utilized it will need to download models from NVIDIA NGC and setup the FLUX NIM container, this process can take up to 20 minutes or more depending on the connection speed.

# Guided GenAI Workflow

There will be an initial connection delay when first connecting to the NIM during a session which may take between 2-5 minutes. 

By default the sample workflow will use the viewport scene combined with the following prompt to generate an image that matches both the overall look of the 3D scene, and the text prompt:  
*“a stunning professional photo of a quaint village in the mountains in winter, a snow covered  fountain is visible in the center of the town square”*

##  Generating New Output

You can change the output, by changing either the text prompt, the 3D viewport information or both. NOTE:  When generating output, some parameter must be changed before it’s possible to generate a new output, either the 3D scene information, prompt, or some parameter. If nothing has been changed the workflow will not process a new image. 

The ComfyUI Connector panel is linked to the Input Text Node, you can change the prompt information here.   
![Untitled-16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc83aba-1177-470d-a27b-7b48ee8ebab6)

In the prompt input area, add some additional information to the end of the existing text to change the output, for example try any of the following:  
“At sunset”  
“At night”  
“In the rain”

### Changing the 3D Scene

With the mouse in the upper left viewport press SHIFT \+ \~ to enter navigation mode. You can fly though the scene using the WASD keys and using the mouse to point in a direction. The E and F keys raise and lower the camera. Navigate the scene to find different camera angles.

### Replace Objects

Click on the fountain object and click delete on the keyboard to remove the fountain.  
![Untitled-18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9c5fb3-85e9-4abd-b74f-4a6dc8322eda)

In the lower left area of the screen grab the boat object and drag it into the upper left viewport to the general location where the fountain was previously.   

Replace the entire prompt with one of these:  
“A stunning profession photo of a modern luxury boat in the canals of Venice, classical buildings, at sunset”  
“An abandoned boat sitting between rows of warehouses”  
![Untitled-19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44988249-0c79-48a9-9fa0-29b5b5dd9a5f)
![Untitled-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54b2dced-d809-4454-8238-69ab5599ba5d)

### Adjusting the Image Output Location
Change the output path in the SaveImage node to point to a location on your system where you would like to save generated images.
![Untitled-21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4189a22-e309-465a-a91c-eb259bc73434)

## Stopping the NIM
Closing Blender after the FLUX NIM has been loaded may leave the NIM running in the background which can unneccesarily consume GPU and System resources, best practice is to stop the NIM when it is no longer needed, or before exiting Blender.

**Steps to stop the NIM:**
1. In the node tree, locate the **LoadNIMNode** node
2. ![Untitled-24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bd7cddb-ed55-4cc3-8b02-2e26f90f58b9)
3. Switch the *operation* setting from **Start** to **Stop**
4. ![Untitled-25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ab49581-5399-463f-b027-7e8baff915ea)
5. Click **Run** to run the workflow
6. This will cause an error in the NIMFLUXNode as the NIM is no longer available to run the workflow.
7. ![Untitled-26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bd59522-4e8f-485a-bd4a-c3865900ed8e)

### Manually stopping a NIM
1. If a NIM isn't stopped via the Stop method of the **LoadNIMNode** it may be necessary to manually stop the NIM via the command console
2. Open a windows command console and type:
3. > wsl podman ps -a
4. ![Untitled-27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/170be810-178f-44ad-bda2-89949105ef3d)
5. This will show the current active NIM containers
6. Note the name of the container **FLUX_DEPTH**
7. Issue the following command:
8. > wsl podman stop FLUX_DEPTH
9. ![Untitled-28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b98f38c7-8ec8-4d65-bd50-6a655f0a35d8)
10. You can re-run the wsl podman ps -a command to verify that the FLUX_NIM is no longer running.


   




# Restarting the ComfyUI Server

If errors occur when working with the NIM it may be necessary to restart the ComfyUI Server. To restart ComfyUI, place your mouse cursor in the ComfyUI node graph area and press “N” to display the panel.  
![Untitled-22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdda5ed7-183f-4f2f-9268-bc5d78918682)

Click the ![image125](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/065a8cc9-460e-48a0-abab-8a8dec9a0994) icon to stop ComfyUI.  
Click the ![image126](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fddc145f-ac73-4228-9639-e69be7abc8bd) icon again to restart ComfyUI, or click the **Launch/Connect to ComfyUI** button.

Re-run the workflow.

# Troubleshooting
**Problem:**  When running Setup.bat you receive an error "tar: LZMA codec is unsupported" "tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors."
**Solution:** Manually extract the *ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z* file using 7-zip. If necessary install 7-zip using `winget install 7-zip` Then issue the following command from a command prompt at the location containing *setup.bat*  `"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z x ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z`  Once the files have successfully extracted, re-run Setup.bat and choose the option to resume the installation.
